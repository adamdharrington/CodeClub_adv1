          <h2 id="batman-cap">The Batman cap</h2>
          <p>
            The Batman cap is my favorite hat. It has the Batman logo on the
            front.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has the retro style logo from the 1980's TV shows starring Adam
            West who played Batman and Burt Ward who played Robin.

          <h3>Why I like it</h3>
          <p>
            I like this hat because it reminds me of my favorite superhero,
            Batman. I also like the blue and yellow colors of the logo.
          </p>
          <p>
            I purchased my hat and my daughter's matching hat from a local comic
            book store and I love when we wear them together.

          <h2 id="brown-beanie">My Brown beanie hat</h2>
          <p>
            This hat was a gift from my wife. It is a simple brown beanie that
            keeps me warm during the winter months.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I like it</h3>
          <p>
            I like this hat because it is very comfortable and it fits well. The
            brown color goes with many of my outfits.
          </p>
          <h3>Trivia</h3>
          <p>
            In Canada beanies are often called toques (pronounced "toohk"). A
            toque is a knitted hat that is typically worn in cold weather to
            keep the head warm.
