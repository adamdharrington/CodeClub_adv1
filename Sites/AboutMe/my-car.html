        <h2>Nissan Pulsar | 2015</h2>
        <p>
          My car is a 2015 Nissan Pulsar. It is a compact hatchback that is fuel
          efficient and reliable.
        </p>
        <h3>Why I like it</h3>
        <p>
          I like my car because it is easy to drive and park. It felt very new
          when I bought it used in 2020 and it has low kilometers. The fuel
          efficiency is fantastic even when petrol prices are high.

              The car has an automatic transmission that makes it easy to drive
              in traffic and that was a must for my wife whose licence restricts
              her to autos.

              The car has a large boot space that can fit all my groceries and
              buggy and I've transported tons of large items in it with ease.
